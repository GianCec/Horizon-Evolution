The metric expansion of the universe is parametrized by an adimensional time-dependent function called a scale factor. This function has several contributions due to the main components of the universe (matter, radiation, dark energy etc.) and is by convention fixed at 1 at the present time. What is shown in the graphs are the worldlines of objects stationary with respect to the universe that move only for the expansion.
