The light cone generated at the present age of the universe. The function of the light cone has a double temporal dependence, one indicates the time at which the cone is generated the other the point where we evaluate the value of the lightcone generated. It is interesting to note that the value of this lightcone at time 0 and the value of the particle horizon at todayâ€™s time are equal.
