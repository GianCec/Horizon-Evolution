The particle horizon of an observer O represents the limit of the causal connection as receiver in the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker metric.
Objects beyond the spherical surface defined by radius equal to the particle horizon and centred in the observer O can't be seen by observer at that given time.
